But we also work every day to apply and share our know-how in ways that benefit people, the community, and our planet in order to build a better tomorrow.\nWe create vehicles by listening and responding to you. Why? Because it\u2019s our belief that our cars should do more than help you go places on the road, they should also help you go places in life.\nWe make vehicles that respond to, and anticipate, your needs for the way you live today \u2014 with advances in sustainable mobility and advanced safety technologies. Find out more about how our operations are improving the world we live in today and long into tomorrow.\nThere is only one planet Earth. Which is why we developed a line of vehicles that make the best possible use of our natural resources, and why we ensure that our facilities and plants minimize waste and energy while maximizing efficiency.\nSafety may begin with the driver, but it certainly doesn\u2019t end there. We're constantly innovating and researching ways to help prevent accidents from ever happening, as well as help protect those inside and outside of our vehicles in the unlikely event of an accident. Then we share our research and data with a variety of universities, government institutions and more to help make the roads safe for everyone.\nOur commitment to our customers extends to giving back to the communities where we live, work and play. We\u2019ve contributed nearly $1.1 billion in the U.S. over the past 60 years to support safety, education, and environmental initiatives across the U.S. since 1991. And, we share our production know-how with nonprofits and community partners from food banks to hospitals \u2014 to help them serve more people, more effectively.\nHow do we create some of the most advanced, reliable and safe vehicles? It starts with our manufacturing principles and management philosophy. We\u2019re always looking for ways to improve our operations, always challenging ourselves to innovate, always looking to collaborate, always improving each day in everything we do.",

    "text": "1849\nCousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart founded Charles Pfizer & Company in a red brick building in Brooklyn, NY.\nOur Compliance Program represents a shared undertaking from the highest levels of management to the most junior employees.\nBecause everyone has something to offer. Diversity is just as crucial to building a successful business as it is to building a vibrant culture.\nWe integrate environment, health, and safety (EHS) into how we run our business to ensure that management of risk and regulatory compliance are overseen at the highest levels of the company. With our EHS Policy as the foundation, implementation of Pfizer's EHS Standards and Audit programs establish the performance expectations for colleagues around the world. Each Pfizer colleague plays a crucial role in facilitating a culture of EHS excellence where all improvements, ideas, and opportunities are welcomed. Our governance framework and culture provide the basis for proactive engagement and shared accountability of EHS across our operations.\nA network of external suppliers is essential to enable manufacture of medicines and vaccines that deliver breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. Pfizer\u2019s supply chain supports the research, development and manufacturing process by providing flexibility and access to technologies necessary to meet our commitment to patients We are committed to using suppliers that demonstrate strong performance in Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) management.\nWe recognize that environmental issues can result in profound societal and public health impacts. Our company purpose\u2014Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives\u2014guides our environmental sustainability priorities, with a focus on climate impact mitigation, conservation of resources, and the reduction of waste arising from our operations.\nWe continue to invest in the groundbreaking science and technology needed to discover tomorrow\u2019s life-saving treatments for patients who need them the most. Our research, development, and manufacturing facilities across the country are fostering next-generation healthcare innovation while creating 30,000 U.S.-based jobs.\nWe are dedicated to helping people find accurate, science-based information as they make healthcare decisions that impact their lives.\nAll patients should have access to the medicines they need. Through our partnerships with global health institutions and implementation of novel pricing structures\u2013including donations where appropriate\u2013we blend philanthropy and business approaches to increase access to our medicines and vaccines where they\u2019re needed most.\nMulticultural Health Equity Collective\nInnovation in Medicine Delivery\nWe deliver scientific breakthroughs through the relentless collaboration of our talented workforce. Therefore, ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our workforce is critical to delivering our purpose. We continue to advance a comprehensive occupational injury and illness prevention program that enables engagement and productivity.\nWe\u2019re committed to conducting business in an ethical and responsible manner. This includes respecting internationally recognized human rights throughout our operations.\nThe Intellectual Property Principles for Advancing Cures and Therapies (IP PACT) is a groundbreaking, unified declaration of 10 key Intellectual Property (IP) principles. Driven by members of the innovative biopharmaceutical industry, it affirms our strong commitment to innovation and to keeping the needs of patients at the heart of our IP practice\nWe support the global healthcare community\u2019s independent initiatives to improve patient outcomes in areas of unmet medical need that are aligned with our medical and/or scientific strategies. The grant requester (and ultimately the grantee) is responsible for the design, implementation, sponsorship, and conduct of the independent initiative supported by the grant, including compliance with any regulatory requirements.\nWe believe that public policy engagement is an important and appropriate role for companies in open societies, when conducted in a legal and transparent manner.\nOur corporate political contributions and lobbying activities are focused on promoting the interest of our company, without regard to the personal political preferences or affiliations of any of our employees, offices, or board members.\nWorking with your doctor and other healthcare professionals is essential to gaining the real-world information we need to deliver treatment choices that improve the health of patients. Four main ways these professionals help us to help patients are through research and development, professional advising and consulting, expert-led forums, and in-office information exchange.\nWe invest in innovative medicines and techniques that drive down the costs of medicine as well as patient assistance when patients can\u2019t afford their medicines. We negotiate medicine pricing with insurers who then determine what you pay out of pocket.\nAssociate Research Fellow and Group Leader, Chemical Development Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\nSenior Vice President of Executive Operations and Chief of Staff and Counsel to the Chairman and CEO\nSenior Director, Oncology Medicinal Chemistry Synthesis and Analytical Group\nSenior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Internal Medicine Research Unit\nAssociate Research Fellow and Group Leader, Chemical Development Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\nSenior Vice President of Executive Operations and Chief of Staff and Counsel to the Chairman and CEO\nSenior Director, Oncology Medicinal Chemistry Synthesis and Analytical Group\nSenior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Internal Medicine Research Unit\nAssociate Research Fellow and Group Leader, Chemical Development Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\nSenior Vice President of Executive Operations and Chief of Staff and Counsel to the Chairman and CEO\nSenior Director, Oncology Medicinal Chemistry Synthesis and Analytical Group\nSenior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Internal Medicine Research Unit\nAssociate Research Fellow and Group Leader, Chemical Development Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\nSenior Vice President of Executive Operations and Chief of Staff and Counsel to the Chairman and CEO\nSenior Director, Oncology Medicinal Chemistry Synthesis and Analytical Group\nSenior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Internal Medicine Research Unit\nCousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart founded Charles Pfizer & Company in a red brick building in Brooklyn, NY.\nPfizer buys and renovates a post-Revolutionary-era building at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan and moves its headquarters there.\nThe expansion propelled by the Civil War continues and Pfizer's revenues double.\nThe company now has a substantially increased product line and 150 new employees. To accommodate this growth, it buys and renovates a post-Revolutionary-era building at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan and moves its headquarters there. The site carries the Pfizer name for nearly a century.\nCollapseSpurred by America's westward expansion and its own growing number of clients west of the Mississippi, Pfizer opens offices and a warehouse in Chicago, Illinois, its first location outside of New York.\nPfizer files an official certificate of incorporation in the state of New Jersey, with authorized capital of $2 million divided into 20,000 shares of $100 each.\nPfizer would remain a privately held company until June 22, 1942, when 240,000 shares of new common stock were offered to the public.\nCollapseEmile Pfizer was the last member of the Pfizer/Erhart family to be actively involved with the company. He was president from 1906 to 1941.\nEmile Pfizer, Charles Pfizer's youngest son, is appointed President at a special board meeting. He serves as President from 1906 to 1941 and briefly as Chairman in 1941. He is the last member of the Pfizer/Erhart family to be actively involved with the company.\nCollapseAt the age of 82, Charles Pfizer dies while vacationing at his Newport, Rhode Island estate. A tribute to Pfizer in The New York Tribune notes that \"by bringing to his task a thorough German technical education, great industry, and determination, he successfully met all difficulties and each year expanded his business.\" Company sales exceed $3 million.\nJohn Anderson, starting at Pfizer in 1873 as an office boy, opened the company's first branch in Chicago within ten years. Later he served as Chairman of the Board, 1914-1929.\nThe Board of Directors creates the position of Chairman and elects John Anderson to that post. Anderson, who had joined Pfizer in 1873 as a 16-year-old office boy, would remain Chairman until 1929.\nPfizer chemist James Currie and his assistant, Jasper Kane, successfully pioneer the mass production of citric acid from sugar through mold fermentation\u2014an achievement that eventually frees Pfizer from dependency on European citrus growers.\nSpurred by this invention, Kane goes on to develop a new deep-tank fermentation method using molasses rather than refined sugar as raw material\u2014the process that will ultimately unlock the secret for large-scale production of penicillin.\nCollapseCharles Pfizer & Co. turns 75 years old.
